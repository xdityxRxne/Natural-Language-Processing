In the sentiment Analysis I have used the Bag of words model to vectorize and extract features from the text. Further upon trying several ML models such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest, the Support Vector Machine Model gave the best results. I have used the 'rbf' - radial basis function kernel since it gave the best results.
